              <p>Elder Quentin L. Cook of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles closed out the Saturday afternoon session of the 195th Semiannual General Conference of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, talking about the recent surge in converts to the Church.</p>
              <p>“In the last 36 months, nearly 900,000 converts have joined the Church. These converts constitute approximately 5% of the total Church membership,” he shared. “In the first six months of this year, conversions have risen by more than 20% over the previous year in Europe, Africa, Asia, the Pacific and Latin America. In North America, we have seen a 17% increase.”</p>

                <p>Elder Cook encouraged members to accept and welcome new and returning members of the Church, echoing the words shared earlier in the meeting by Elder Gerrit W. Gong.</p>
                <p>He concluded his message by saying, “As we contemplate the challenges of our day, we must remember that the Savior, during His earthly ministry, also lived in turbulent and violent times. His focus was not on the political challenges of the day; it was on the perfection of the Saints. Following the Savior and His doctrine and teachings has never been easy in a world that is constantly in commotion. It was not easy for the Savior in the volatile world during his mortal sojourn, it was not easy for our early leaders and members, and it is not easy for us. Fortunately, living prophets provide the guidance we respectfully need for our day. President Dallin H. Oaks will continue that spiritually powerful legacy.”</p>

              <p>Elder David A. Bednar of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles conducted the session from the Conference Center in Salt Lake City, Utah. He noted the passing of President Russell M. Nelson, adding that his presence “will be greatly missed.”</p>
              <p>Elder Ronald A. Rasband of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles focused his message on “The Family: A Proclamation to the World,” which is celebrating its 30th anniversary this year.</p>
              <p>“Everyone belongs to a family, whether you are a mother, father, daughter, son, grandchild, grandparent, aunt, uncle, brother, sister, or cousin. Most importantly, each of us are, as the [Family] Proclamation states, ‘a beloved spirit son or daughter of heavenly parents . . . [with] a divine nature and destiny,’” he said.</p>
              <p>He taught that the proclamation, as then President Gordon B. Hinckley stated in 1995, is doctrine.</p>

              <p>In speaking to those who may feel alone at Church or like they don’t belong, Elder Gerrit W. Gong of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles invited all to “worry less, judge less, be less demanding of others — and, when needed, be less hard on ourselves.”</p>
            <p>“On the dusty roads to Jericho, each of us has been laughed at, embarrassed and hurt, perhaps scorned or abused. And, with varying degrees of intent, each of us has also disregarded, not seen or heard, perhaps deliberately hurt others,” he added. “It is precisely because we have been hurt and have hurt others that Jesus Christ brings us to His inn. In His Church and through His ordinances and covenants, we come to each other and to Jesus Christ. We love and are loved, serve and are served, forgive and are forgiven. Please remember, ‘earth has no sorrow that heav’n can’t heal’; earth burdens lighten — our Savior’s joy is real.”</p>
            <p>Brother Chad H Webb, First Counselor in the Sunday School General Presidency, taught about the importance of being diligent learners and turning to the Holy Ghost, “a perfect tutor,” as we study the gospel.</p>
            <p>“The gospel is not a list of demands; it’s the good news that Jesus Christ overcame sin and death,” he said.</p>
        <p>Elder Jeremy R. Jaggi, a General Authority Seventy, spoke about altars historically being used to worship God, adding this invitation to all: “Our Savior’s arms are outstretched; His table is spread. Come worship the Son of God at His holy altars.”</p>

       <p>Elder Kevin G. Brown, a General Authority Seventy, focused his thoughts on three “powerful truths” of the Restoration — 1. God is a loving Heavenly Father, 2. Agency is the gift to choose and act, and 3. A testimony comes through the power of the Holy Ghost.</p>
    <p>“A testimony through the Holy Ghost can come in many ways,” he said. “Like a light bulb in a dark room, it can come on dramatically and suddenly. It can come like the sunrise gradually and over time. It can come like rays of light, intermittent exposure to pure intelligence. Whatever the way, what matters is that it comes through the Holy Ghost.”</p>
    <p>Elder Michael Cziesla, a General Authority Seventy, spoke about the power that comes from living pure and simple doctrine.</p>
    <p>“Applying the doctrine of Christ in a simplified and focused way will help us to find joy in our daily lives, give guidance in our callings, answer some of life’s most complex questions and provide strength to face our greatest challenges,” he said</p>
